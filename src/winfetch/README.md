# winfetch - display system information
A small utility to display system information in the terminal, inspired by *screenfetch*.

Not beautiful but fast :-)

## Usage
Just launch `winfetch.exe` on the command-line.

## Known Bugs/Missing Features
- Windows-Logo is ugly.
- relies on `WMIC` to gather the information but this tool is deprecated by Microsoft.
- no color support ATM, sorry for that...
